# LargeLanguageModel

In order to run this model you will need the following libraries:

numpy
matplotlib
pylzma
ipykernel
jupyter
torch

Due to file size, I was unable to upload any training data, so this LLM will require training if downloaded from my github.

You can give the LLM data to train on by creating a "romeo_juliet.txt" file (this data was trained on my local machine to output shakespearean english) with training data, anything over ~25000 lines will not compile.
