# LargeLanguageModel

In order to run this model you need to run the following command in your terminal.

pip3 install jupyter ipykernel pylzma torch matplotlib numpy.

Due to file size, I was unable to upload any training data, so this LLM will require training if downloaded from my github.

You can give the LLM data to train on by creating a "romeo_juliet.txt" file with training data, anything over ~25000 lines will not compile.
